# Cloud Resume Challenge

## Overview
The Cloud Resume Project was an initiative I undertook to build and showcase my skills in cloud computing, particularly using Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

It provided a structured approach for creating a resume website hosted on AWS and offered me the opportunity to learn and implement various AWS services and best practices.

## Features

- **Resume Website**: Built a professional resume website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **AWS Integration**: Hosted the website on AWS using Amazon S3 for static content hosting, CloudFront for content delivery, and Route 53 for DNS management.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Defined and provisioned the required AWS resources, including the S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and Route 53 hosted zone, using Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Implemented continuous deployment pipelines using Terraform to automate the deployment process.
