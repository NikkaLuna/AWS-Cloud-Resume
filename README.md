# Cloud Resume Challenge

## Overview
The Cloud Resume Project was an initiative I undertook to build and showcase my skills in cloud computing, particularly using Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

It provided a structured approach for creating a resume website hosted on AWS and offered me the opportunity to learn and implement various AWS services and best practices.

## Features

- **Resume Website**: Built a professional resume website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **AWS Integration**: Hosted the website on AWS using Amazon S3 for static content hosting, CloudFront for content delivery, and Route 53 for DNS management.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Defined and provisioned the required AWS resources, including the S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, and Route 53 hosted zone, using Terraform as the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Implemented continuous deployment pipelines using Terraform to automate the deployment process.

## AWS Lambda Function Management

*This screenshot displays the AWS Lambda function VisitorCountFunction, which is integrated with an API Gateway to manage visitor counts. The Python script in the code editor handles the logic for incrementing the count in the VisitorCount DynamoDB table. This setup showcases AWS Lambda for serverless computing and real-time data processing.*
